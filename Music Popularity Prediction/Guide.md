# Music Prediction System ðŸŽµ

This folder contains a **Music Prediction System** developed for learning and experimentation with Machine Learning.

---

Original Work

This project is **originally created by [Aman Kharwal](https://amanxai.com/2024/07/08/music-popularity-prediction-with-python/)**.  
**Adapted and modified for learning purposes** to explore machine learning implementation for music popularity prediction.

---

## Overview

The system predicts music popularity based on various input features using machine learning techniques. It is designed to help beginners understand how ML models can be applied to real-world tasks in the music industry.

Music popularity prediction involves building models to estimate the success of tracks using audio characteristics, metadata, and historical performance. Accurate predictions can help:

- Music streaming platforms understand user preferences  
- Optimize playlists and recommendation systems  
- Support artists, producers, and marketers in making informed decisions  

---

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of **227 music tracks**, each described by multiple features:

- Track name  
- Artist(s)  
- Album name  
- Release date  
- Audio features and metadata  

This dataset allows the model to learn patterns and predict expected popularity, measured by streams, downloads, and chart performance.

---

## Objectives

- Preprocess music data and extract meaningful features  
- Train regression models to predict music popularity  
- Evaluate and interpret model predictions  
- Gain hands-on experience applying ML techniques to real-world scenarios
